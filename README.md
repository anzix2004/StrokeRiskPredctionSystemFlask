# StrokeRiskPredctionSystem
Stroke is a leading cause of death and disability worldwide, where early diagnosis and timely intervention are crucial to improving patient outcomes. However, complex risk factors and limited access to healthcare professionals often delay diagnosis. Addressing this issue, the Stroke Risk Prediction System has been developed as an advanced platform that uses machine learning to enable early stroke risk detection and seamless interaction among administrators, doctors, and patients.

The system adopts a modular architecture tailored to each stakeholder. At its core, it utilizes powerful machine learning algorithms to analyze user-provided data and predict stroke risk accurately, enabling early intervention and better health outcomes.

For administrators, the platform offers a secure dashboard to manage the system. They can approve or reject doctor registrations, oversee dataset management for ML training and testing, handle user complaints, and monitor doctor performance based on ratings and feedback. This ensures high-quality service and platform reliability.

The doctorsâ€™ module empowers medical professionals to manage profiles, consultation fees, schedules, and appointments. Doctors can view patient details, receive payments, communicate in real-time, and track their ratings. This fosters improved doctor-patient interaction and encourages service improvement.

The user (patient) module is designed for accessibility and ease of use. Patients can register, input data for risk prediction, receive results, search for doctors based on rating, proximity, or fees, book appointments, make payments, and engage in real-time chat with doctors. They can also submit feedback and complaints, promoting transparency and accountability.

Technologically, the system is built using Python and Flask for backend development, with a mobile app developed in Android for better accessibility. Databases are managed using SQLYog and WAMP, while development is carried out in Android Studio and Visual Studio Code.
